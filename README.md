# Cache Simulation And Performace Analysis
This project is a part of Computer Architecture Course under Prof. Nanditha Rao at IIITB.
The python code simulates a cache behavior for various traces(gcc, gzip, mcf, swim, twolf) and checks how perfomace is affected on changing the specifications of the cache such as its associativity, cache size, block size, etc.
